# EZ-Studios: The Anti-Patterns Manifesto ☠️
*Why Indie Projects Die & How to Survive the Filter*

> "Success is not just about doing the right things. It's about avoiding the fatal things."

This document catalogs the strategic errors that kill 95% of game studios before they reach profitability. These are the "Great Filters" we must actively avoid.

---

## 1. The Perfectionism Trap (A Ilusão do Lançamento Perfeito)
**The Error:** Waiting for the game to be "feature complete" before releasing.
**The Reality:** The first version is never "The Game". It is a **Hypothesis Validation Tool**. If you build for 2 years without users, you are building a coffin.
**The Sovereign Antidote:** "Vertical Slice" philosophy. Build the first 5 minutes. Release. Measure retention. Iterate.
*   *Target:* Release Validation Builds every 30-60 days.

## 2. Monetization Afterthought (A Falácia da Monetização Tardia)
**The Error:** "I'll make it fun first, and figure out how to make money later."
**The Reality:** Economy **IS** Gameplay. If monetization isn't baked into the core loop (Sinks/Faucets), adding it later breaks the game or feels predatory.
**The Sovereign Antidote:** Design the Economy Spec (`neo_arkaia_economy_spec.md`) before the first pixel. Define what is Inflationary (Fiat) and what is Scarce (Sovereign).

## 3. The "Organic Viral" Fallacy (O Mito do Viral)
**The Error:** Believing a "good game" markets itself.
**The Reality:** Quality is a prerequisite, not a marketing strategy. Even masterpieces die in obscurity without a funnel.
**The Sovereign Antidote:** Build in Public. Use the game logic itself (Architect Academy) as a marketing tool. Turn players into evangelists via "Proof of Learning" and Status.

## 4. Ignoring Player Psychology (Dopamina vs. Lógica)
**The Error:** Prioritizing clean code/logic over player emotion.
**The Reality:** Players don't care about your backend. They care about how they **feel**.
**The Sovereign Antidote:**
*   **Visual Status:** Skins must scream competence immediately.
*   **Number Go Up:** Use inflated numbers (Entropy Bits) where dopamine is needed.
*   **Fear of Missing Out (FOMO):** Convergence Feeds and global alerts.

## 5. Premature Complexity (A Maldição da Feature Creep)
**The Error:** Building 50 mediocre mechanics instead of 5 excellent ones.
**The Reality:** Players remember the peak moments. A game with one amazing mechanic beats a game with 100 average ones.
**The Sovereign Antidote:** Focus on the **Core Loop** (Boot -> Calibration -> Heist). Cut everything else until the core is perfect.

## 6. Platform Lock-in (O Pecado Capital)
**The Error:** Building 100% dependency on a rented platform (Roblox, Steam, Unity).
**The Reality:** If you don't own the relationship with the user, you own nothing.
**The Sovereign Antidote:**
*   **Externalize Community:** Discord is the HQ, not the Roblox Group.
*   **Externalize Value:** Web3 Bridge ($ARK) holds the real wealth.
*   **Agnostic Code:** Logic written in Luau/Rojo can be ported to Godot/Rust.

### **Conclusion**
To initiate a project is easy. To finish requires discipline. To profit requires Strategy.
**We do not build to play. We build to Sovereign.**
